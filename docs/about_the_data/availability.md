Furthermore, there is a [Data Statistics](https://aurorax.space/data/statistics) page that provides additional statistics about data in the AuroraX database.

## Getting availability information programmatically

The availability information is also available using different methods such as PyAuroraX or the API using HTTP requests. Have a look at the documentation on this website for more details on how to do this.
