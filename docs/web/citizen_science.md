# Citizen Science

A component of AuroraX is to engage with citizen scientists in a meaningful way to help bring them closer to researchers across the globe.

To do this, we are working on a way to browse and upload images taken by citizen scientists in an effort to help centralize the location of all auroral images useful for research purposes. The [Citizen Science Photo Gallery](https://aurorax.space/gallery) will be an interface available for browsing images of this type, and to upload your own. 

The gallery tool is under development and will be made accessible once completed.
