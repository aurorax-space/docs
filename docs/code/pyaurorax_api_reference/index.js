"doc":"The  PyAuroraX class is the primary entry point for utilizing this library. It is used to initialize a session, capturing details about API connectivity, environment, and more. All submodules are encapsulated within this class, so any usage of the library starts with creating this object.   import pyaurorax aurorax = pyaurorax.PyAuroraX()   When working with this object, you can set configuration parameters, such as the destination directory for downloaded data, or API special settings (e.g., timeout, HTTP headers, API key). These parameters can be set when instantiating the object, or after instantiating using the self-contained accessible variables. Attributes: download_output_root_path (str): Destination directory for downloaded data. The default for this path is a subfolder in the user's home directory, such as  /home/user/pyaurorax_data in Linux. In Windows and Mac, it is similar. read_tar_temp_path (str): Temporary directory used for tar extraction phases during file reading (e.g., reading TREx RGB Burst data). The default for this is   /.tar_temp_working . For faster performance when reading tar-based data, one option on Linux is to set this to use RAM directly at  /dev/shm/pyaurorax_tar_temp_working . api_base_url (str): URL prefix to use when interacting with the AuroraX API. By default this is set to  https: api.aurorax.space . This parameter is primarily used by the development team to test and build new functions using the private staging API. api_timeout (int): The timeout used when communicating with the Aurorax API. This value is represented in seconds, and by default is  10 seconds . api_headers (Dict): HTTP headers used when communicating with the AuroraX API. The default for this value consists of several standard headers. Any changes to this parameter are in addition to the default standard headers. api_key (str): API key to use when interacting with the AuroraX API. The default value is None. Please note that an API key is only required for write operations to the AuroraX search API, such as creating data sources or uploading ephemeris data. srs_obj (pyucalgarysrs.PyUCalgarySRS): A [PyUCalgarySRS](https: docs-pyucalgarysrs.phys.ucalgary.ca/ pyucalgarysrs.PyUCalgarySRS) object. If not supplied, it will create the object with some settings carried over from the PyAuroraX object. Note that specifying this is for advanced users and only necessary a few special use-cases.

However, the optional parameters  timescale_auroral and  timescale_transport provide limited support for time-dependent and transport process. The  timescale_auroral parameter (T0) is the duration of the precipitation. The  timescale_transport parameter is defined by L/v0, in which L is the dimension of the auroral structure, and v0 is the cross-structure drift speed. The model quasi-analytically solves the continuity equation under a square input (with time duration T0 and spatial width L) input of precipitation. The initial/boundary conditions are given by IRI.

Args: y_type (str): Type of y-axis to use when plotting. Options are  ccd ,  mag , or  geo . The default is  ccd . This parameter is required. title (str): The title to display above the plotted keogram. figsize (tuple): The matplotlib figure size to use when plotting. For example  figsize=(14,4) . cmap (str): The matplotlib colormap to use. Commonly used colormaps are: - REGO:  gist_heat - THEMIS ASI:  gray - TREx Blue:  Blues_r - TREx NIR:  gray - TREx RGB:  None A list of all available colormaps can be found on the [matplotlib documentation](https: matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html). aspect (str or float): The matplotlib imshow aspect ration to use. A common value for this is  auto . All valid values can be found on the [matplotlib documentation](https: matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html). axes_visible (bool): Display the axes. Default is  True . xlabel (str): The x-axis label to use. Default is  Time (UTC) . ylabel (str): The y-axis label to use. Default is based on y_type. xtick_increment (int): The x-axis tick increment to use. Default is 100. ytick_increment (int): The y-axis tick increment to use. Default is 50. returnfig (bool): Instead of displaying the image, return the matplotlib figure object. This allows for further plot manipulation, for example, adding labels or a title in a different location than the default. Remember - if this parameter is supplied, be sure that you close your plot after finishing work with it. This can be achieved by doing  plt.close(fig) . Note that this method cannot be used in combination with  savefig . savefig (bool): Save the displayed image to disk instead of displaying it. The parameter savefig_filename is required if this parameter is set to True. Defaults to  False . savefig_filename (str): Filename to save the image to. Must be specified if the savefig parameter is set to True. savefig_quality (int): Quality level of the saved image. This can be specified if the savefig_filename is a JPG image. If it is a PNG, quality is ignored. Default quality level for JPGs is matplotlib/Pillow's default of 75%. Returns: The displayed keogram, by default. If  savefig is set to True, nothing will be returned. If  returnfig is set to True, the plotting variables  (fig, ax) will be returned. Raises: ValueError: Issues with the y-axis choice.",

Default value is 1. Adjust according to your computer's available resources. This parameter is optional. first_record (bool): Only read in the first record in each file. This is the same as the first_frame parameter in the themis-imager-readfile and trex-imager-readfile libraries, and is a read optimization if you only need one image per minute, as opposed to the full temporal resolution of data (e.g., 3sec cadence). This parameter is optional. no_metadata (bool): Skip reading of metadata. This is a minor optimization if the metadata is not needed. Default is  False . This parameter is optional. start_time (datetime.datetime): The start timestamp to read data onwards from (inclusive). This can be utilized to read a portion of a data file, and could be paired with the  end_time parameter. This tends to be utilized for datasets that are hour or day-long files where it is possible to only read a smaller bit of that file. An example is the TREx Spectrograph processed data (1 hour files), or the riometer data (1 day files). If not supplied, it will assume the start time is the timestamp of the first record in the first file supplied (ie. beginning of the supplied data).
